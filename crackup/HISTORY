Crackup Release History

Version 1.0.2 (?)
  * Storage drivers have been broken out into separate gems to make installation
    of third-party drivers easier. The filesystem and FTP drivers will still be
    installed by default along with the main Crackup gem.

Version 1.0.1 (11/21/2006)
  * Fix broken handling of symbolic links.
  * Expand relative paths before backing up.
  * Win32: If gpg.exe isn't in the system path, look for it at the path
    specified in the HKCU\Software\GNU\GnuPG\gpgProgram registry key (if the key
    exists) before failing.

Version 1.0.0 (11/16/2006)
  * First release.
