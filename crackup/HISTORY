Crackup Release History

Version 1.0.2 (?)
  * Added an optional SFTP storage driver (contributed by Brett Stimmerman).
  * Added an optional Amazon S3 storage driver.
  * When restoring individual files or directories, match against the base
    filename in addition to the full path. 
  * Fix "undefined local variable or method 'result'" error when restoring
    individual files or directories.
  * Storage drivers have been broken out into separate gems to make distribution
    and installation of third-party drivers easier. The filesystem and FTP
    drivers will still be installed by default along with the main Crackup gem.

  * Fix broken handling of symbolic links.
  * Expand relative paths before backing up.
  * Win32: If gpg.exe isn't in the system path, look for it at the path
    specified in the HKCU\Software\GNU\GnuPG\gpgProgram registry key (if the key
    exists) before failing.

Version 1.0.0 (11/16/2006)
  * First release.
