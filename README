= Crackup (Crappy Remote Backup)

Crackup is a pretty simple, pretty secure remote backup solution for folks who
want to keep their data securely backed up but aren't particularly concerned
about bandwidth usage.

Crackup is ideal for backing up lots of small files, but somewhat less ideal
for backing up large files, since any change to a file means the entire file
must be transferred. If you need something bandwidth-efficient, try Duplicity.

Backups are compressed and encrypted via GPG and can be transferred to the
remote location over a variety of protocols, including FTP.
